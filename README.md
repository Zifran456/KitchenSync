# Group I - KitchenSync

This repository contains all documents and source code for the ENSE 281 Group Project by Group I.

## Project Introduction & Background 📝

This web application aims to reduce household food waste and aid in decision making by creating a system that provides its users with various recipes and the tools to track food inventory whilst simultaneously allowing them to track food expiration dates.

## Business Opportunity 📍

The project will allow users to keep track of their food inventory and give user access to a variety of recipes based off said inventory, hence, assisting the users decision making on what to eat. Users will be able to adequately plan meals and maintain awareness of the quality of food in their inventory whilst also cutting food wastage and cost, eating better and healthier.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) 💻

This web application will allow for:
* Users to input any food items into any designated storages
* Users to track expiry dates on their food items
* Users to receive recipe suggestions based on food items stored and/or items nearing expiry date
* Users to browse and save recipes

## Intended Impact 🕖

The current reality of food waste and disorganization becomes a new reality where food usage is intentional, efficient, and cost-effective.

We envision a simple system where:
  - Food is clearly tracked by storage location
  - Expiry dates are visible and actionable
  - Waste is minimized
  - Meal planning is partially automated based on what is already available
  - Unnecessary grocery spending is reduced

## Target Customers 🎯

Our main audience includes:
  - Home cooks and budget-conscious individuals
  - Families managing large or shared food inventories
  - Students or roommates sharing fridge and pantry space

## Team 🤝

- Zifran Chowdhury
- Deran Cross
- Ikechukwu Ogowuihe
- Emmanuel Dairo

## Project Status 🟢

MVP complete. Backend integrated with Express, MongoDB, and EJS views.

## How to Run

> **Requires:** Node.js and a MongoDB instance (local or Atlas).

```bash
# Move into the app folder first
cd app

# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Development (auto-restarts on file changes)
npm run dev

# Production
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `app/` folder:

```
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/kitchensync
SESSION_SECRET=kitchensync-super-secret-key-change-in-production
```

### Seeding Recipe Data

To populate the database with recipes (run once after setup):

```bash
node seed-recipes.js

## Features

- Filter tabs (All / Expired / Expiring Soon / Low Stock)
- Built-in storage pages (Fridge, Freezer, Pantry) with expiry colour coding
- Custom storages — create and name your own storage locations, delete with all their items
- Item status calculated server-side based on expiry date:
  - **Expired** — past expiry date (red left border)
  - **Expiring Soon** — within 7 days (orange left border)
  - **Good** — more than 7 days out (green left border)
- Low Stock — items with quantity ≤ 2
- Recipe suggestions on dashboard (top 3, scored by expiring items first)
